### Section 2: Redis Core Concepts and Basic Data Types

#### Lesson 4: Working with Strings

- **String Commands**: Learn how to store, retrieve, and modify string values in Redis.
- **Basic String Operations**: Use commands like `SET`, `GET`, `INCR`, `DECR`, and `APPEND`.
- **Use Cases**: See examples of strings in caching and counters.

#### Lesson 5: Lists in Redis

- **List Commands**: Learn to add, retrieve, and remove items in lists with `LPUSH`, `RPUSH`, `LRANGE`, and `LPOP`.
- **Use Cases**: Discuss queue implementations and recent items storage.

#### Lesson 6: Sets and Sorted Sets in Redis

- **Working with Sets**: Understand set commands (`SADD`, `SREM`, `SMEMBERS`, `SUNION`) and when to use sets.
- **Using Sorted Sets**: Learn sorted set commands (`ZADD`, `ZRANGE`, `ZREM`) and how to maintain ordered data.
- **Use Cases**: Discuss leaderboards, rankings, and unique data storage.

#### Lesson 7: Hashes in Redis

- **Working with Hashes**: Understand how to work with Redis hashes for storing key-value pairs.
- **Hash Commands**: Learn commands like `HSET`, `HGET`, `HDEL`, `HGETALL`.
- **Use Cases**: Discuss user profiles and object storage.

### Section 3: Intermediate Redis – Advanced Data Types and Concepts

#### Lesson 8: Working with HyperLogLogs for Unique Counting

- **HyperLogLog Overview**: Learn about approximate counting for large datasets.
- **Using HyperLogLog Commands**: Commands like `PFADD`, `PFCOUNT`, and `PFMERGE`.
- **Use Cases**: Track unique visitors and other count-heavy data.

#### Lesson 9: Redis Bitmaps for Binary Operations

- **Bitmap Basics**: How to use bitmaps for binary data in Redis.
- **Bitmap Commands**: Commands like `SETBIT`, `GETBIT`, `BITCOUNT`, and `BITOP`.
- **Use Cases**: Track user activity over time (e.g., daily active users).

#### Lesson 10: Streams – Real-Time Event Processing in Redis

- **Introduction to Streams**: Learn about the Redis Streams data type for handling real-time events.
