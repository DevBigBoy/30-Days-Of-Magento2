# Code generation

- One of the neat features of the Magento application is code generation.
Code generation, as implied by its name, generates nonexistent classes.
These classes are generated in Magento's var/generation directory

-The directory structure within var/generation is somewhat similar to that
of the core vendor/magento/module-* and app/code directories. To be
more precise, it follows the module structure. The code is generated for
something that is called Factory, Proxy, and Interceptor classes.
