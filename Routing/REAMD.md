# 🏡 Basic Routing

## The Default Route Files

In Magento 2, routes are defined using `routes.xml`:

| Area        | Path                              | Router ID |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- | --------- |
| Frontend    | `etc/frontend/routes.xml`          | `standard` |
| Adminhtml   | `etc/adminhtml/routes.xml`         | `admin`    |

Example:

```xml
<router id="standard">
    <route id="vendor_module" frontName="custompath">
        <module name="Vendor_Module" />
    </route>
</router>
```

- `frontName`: Appears in URL
- `module`: The responsible module

---

## Redirect Routes

To perform redirects inside a controller:

```php
return $this->resultRedirectFactory->create()->setPath('module/controller/action');
```

Useful for post-save redirects in admin or login redirects in frontend.

---

## View Routes

If your controller renders a full page (PHTML layout), return a `PageFactory`:

```php
return $this->resultPageFactory->create();
```

Otherwise, you can return JSON, Raw, or Redirect responses.

---

## Listing Your Routes

Magento 2 doesn't have a single route-list command like Laravel, but you can inspect generated routes:

- Check `generated/metadata/`
- Use Xdebug or tools like `bin/magento dev:router:list` (requires extensions).

---

## Routing Customization

You can **override** routes from other modules by:

- Using the same `id`
- Using the `before` attribute
- Declaring higher priority

Example:

```xml
<route id="customer" frontName="newcustomer" />
```

This changes `customer/account/login` to `newcustomer/account/login`.

---

# 🛤️ Route Parameters

## Required Parameters

Magento handles parameters in controllers through `$this->getRequest()`:

Example URL:
```plaintext
/custompath/post/view/id/15
```

Retrieve in controller:

```php
$id = $this->getRequest()->getParam('id');
```

---

## Optional Parameters

Optional parameters are just missing from the URL.

Check safely:

```php
$id = $this->getRequest()->getParam('id', null);
```
- Default value will be `null` if not set.

---

## Regular Expression Constraints

Magento 2 does not have built-in regex route matching like Laravel.  
You need to manually validate parameters:

```php
if (!is_numeric($id)) {
    throw new \Magento\Framework\Exception\LocalizedException(__('Invalid ID'));
}
```

Or use a router plugin for more complex patterns (advanced).

---

# 🏷️ Named Routes

Magento 2 **does not name routes natively**.  
Instead, use `UrlInterface` to dynamically generate URLs safely:

```php
$this->urlBuilder->getUrl('custompath/controller/action', ['id' => 10]);
```

This approach prevents hardcoding URLs, similar to "named routes" in Laravel.

---

# 🛤️ Route Groups

Magento doesn't have formal "groups" like Laravel, but it supports similar concepts:

## Middleware

Adminhtml routes **require authentication** automatically.  
You can create **custom middleware** (using Observers or Plugins) to inject pre-processing logic.

Example: Check permissions, modify response.

---

## Controllers

Group controllers logically under namespaces:

```
Controller/
  ├── Post/
  │   └── View.php
  ├── Comment/
  │   └── Add.php
```

URL structure:

```plaintext
/custompath/post/view
/custompath/comment/add
```

---

## Subdomain Routing

Magento 2 Enterprise can handle multiple stores/subdomains but **not at the route level** by default.  
Multi-store setup with URL rewrites is the usual method.

---

## Route Prefixes

For Adminhtml, you get automatic `/admin/` prefix based on backend URL settings.

You can add custom prefixes by adjusting route definitions or creating rewrite rules.

---

## Route Name Prefixes

You can simulate "prefixing" by consistent naming conventions inside `routes.xml`:

Example:

```xml
<route id="vendor_module_admin" frontName="moduleadmin">
```

---

# 🔗 Route Model Binding

Magento 2 doesn't have auto-model-binding like Laravel (where models auto-inject based on IDs).  
You manually load models in controllers.

---

## Implicit Binding

Manual model loading example:

```php
$id = (int) $this->getRequest()->getParam('id');
$model = $this->_objectManager->create(\Vendor\Module\Model\Item::class)->load($id);
```

Best practice: Inject repositories instead of using ObjectManager directly.

---

## Implicit Enum Binding

Magento 2 doesn't natively support enum binding.

But you can simulate it with service classes or validation.

---

## Explicit Binding

Manually enforce loading using services:

```php
public function __construct(
    \Vendor\Module\Api\ItemRepositoryInterface $itemRepository
) {
    $this->itemRepository = $itemRepository;
}

public function execute()
{
    $id = $this->getRequest()->getParam('id');
    $item = $this->itemRepository->getById($id);
}
```

---

# 🧯 Fallback Routes

Magento 2 handles "404 not found" internally.

You can create custom fallback controllers by overriding:

```php
vendor/magento/module-cms/Controller/NoRoute/Index.php
```

Or through custom router modules.

---

# 🚦 Rate Limiting

Magento 2 does not have built-in route rate limiting like Laravel.

You can implement your own:

- Observer that monitors requests per IP/session
- Use Middleware/Plugin to reject too many requests
- Or integrate third-party security modules like Amasty, Mageplaza.

---

# 📦 Conclusion

Magento 2 routing is flexible, powerful, and can be extended.  
While it doesn't directly mirror Laravel's convenience for route binding and naming, it provides a solid foundation for complex applications — **if you design carefully!**

✅ Define routes clearly  
✅ Load models manually and safely  
✅ Implement ACL for admin security  
✅ Use URL builders, not hardcoded links  
✅ Validate parameters explicitly
